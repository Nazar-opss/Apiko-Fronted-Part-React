Final Project Requirements
Final Project Requirements

“\*” - additional optional tasks

Basic notes:
All fields should be validated on user input instantly
All async changes made by user should have UI loading state (overlay with spinner above items, spinner on submit button, etc)

There should be only 1 opened popup at the same time

Such actions as page transitions or displaying results should be reactive without page reload

Mobile responsiveness can be ignored but it would be great to have (Additional score will be applied)
